upstream remote is the main source of the project that a team is collaborating on.

Can collect all the latest changes to upstream remote using fetch

Can fork upstream to github, then clone to local

The repo that was forked is called the upstream, the copy of repo is the orgin (a copy of the original repo)

local master should mirror the upstream remote, any added features user makes should be done on branches. When done with changes then merge with master

orgin is used to push and pull changes

When want to merge orgin with upstream, need to make a pull request
